# Description

This application is a **recursive** number guessing game which uses **binary search** method (divides the search criteria by half each time) that can call itself to guess the correct number. The logic uses a search Trie data structure to solve a number guessing game in the most efficient way possible with the binary logarithm (log2 n).

- Reduces the search in half each time (log2(n)).
- e.g. search `=log2(100000000)` on google to find out how many guesses it takes to find a number in a list of 1 billion numbers. (29 guesses)

> Very powerful search algorithm that can be used in many different ways.
